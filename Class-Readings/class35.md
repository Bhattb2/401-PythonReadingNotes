- A **graph** : A non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
- **Vertex**: A node with zero or more adjacent vertices.
- **Edge** - Connection between two nodes.
- **Neighbor**: Adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- **Degree**: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- **Undirected Graph**: A graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional.
- **Directed Graph**: Also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed
- **Complete graph**: When all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- **Connected graph**: Graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
- **Disconnected graph**: Graph where some vertices may not have edges.
- **A cycle**: When a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself. A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- **Weighted graph**: When the connections(“edges”) between each node have a different weighted value assigned to them and you can create a weighted matrix that replaces the “1” and “0” with the actual weight values between the two nodes
